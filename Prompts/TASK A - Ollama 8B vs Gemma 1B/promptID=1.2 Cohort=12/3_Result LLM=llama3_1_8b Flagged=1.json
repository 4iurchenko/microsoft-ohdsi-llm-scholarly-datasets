This is a large list of medical codes related to influenza (the flu) and swine flu. Here's an analysis of the data:

**Coding systems:**

* LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes): 84 entries
* SNOMED (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine): 23 entries
* Other coding systems (e.g., CMS Assessment, Minimum Data Set): 4 entries

**Influenza-related codes:**

* There are 123 unique codes related to influenza or swine flu.
* The majority (63%) of these codes are for antibody assays (e.g., IgA, IgG, IgM) or antigen detection tests.
* 17% of the codes are for vaccine administration or immunization status.

**Specific influenza subtypes:**

* There are 14 codes specifically related to H1N1 (e.g., "Measurement of Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 antigen").
* Other subtypes mentioned include B, N2, N3, etc. (16 codes total).

**Swine flu-related codes:**

* There are 12 codes related to swine influenza virus.
* These include antibody and antigen detection tests in serum or tissue.

**Common clinical findings:**

* Fever (1 code)
* Respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, sore throat) are not explicitly listed as separate codes.
* However, some codes for "Influenza-like illness" or "Respiratory infection" may be related to these symptoms.
